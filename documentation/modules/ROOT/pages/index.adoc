== Introduction

Welcome!

In this introductory workshop, you'll learn how to use *Red Hat OpenShift Data Science* to recognize licence plates in car pictures, and extract the number from this plate.

* We'll start from an image like this:

image::car.png[alt text]

* Then we'll automatically recognize and extract this image:

image::plate.png[alt text]

* From which we will recognize the plate number, *S7JDW* !

And all of this without having to install anything on your own computer, thanks to *Red Hat OpenShift Data Science*!
